## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I’m Sam — an engineer who fell in love with data.  
I speak Python more than C++ these days, and I’m currently diving into the data science world.  
Currently focused on mastering advanced machine learning, model tuning, and building real-world data apps — all powered by curiosity (and coffee).  
Curious mind. Fast learner. Big believer in tech + purpose.
